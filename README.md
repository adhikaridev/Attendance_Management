# Attendance_Management


This program is capable of performing three major tasks.
i. Through this program, teachers can carry out the attendance of all the
students in a class. Usually, the number of absent students is much less
than that of present students. Therefore it is easy to enter by absent roll
mubers.
ii. Students and teachers can view the attendance reports of all the students of
the class.
iii. They can also view the attendance report of single student of the class at a
time.
iv. The program displays the percentage of attendance of all the students.
v. The program carries out the attendance of not just one subject, but of a
variety of subjects.
